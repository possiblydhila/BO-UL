# BNI Loyalty — Back Office Portal

Feature reference for the `banking-loyalty-back-office` prototype. Use this document to track module scope, user flows, data shapes, and implementation status as the app evolves.

## Overview

**Purpose:** Front-end prototype for a banking loyalty program back-office portal. Targets operations, product, finance, and approval teams who manage loyalty points (earning/redemption rules), monitor KPIs, and eventually run reports.

**Branding:** BNI Loyalty — Back Office Portal

**Stack:**

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | React 19 |
| Language | TypeScript 5.8 (strict) |
| Build | Vite 7 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3.4 + custom design tokens |
| Charts | Recharts 2.15 |
| Icons | Lucide React |

**Architecture:** For system architecture, domain model, phased backend plan, and prototype gap analysis, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

**Last updated:** 2026-06-25 11:55 WIB (`f804673`)

**Prototype constraints:**

- Mock data only — no backend, API, or persistence
- No authentication — role toggle is UI-only
- No URL routing — navigation via `useState<RouteKey>` in `src/App.tsx`
- All pages live in a single `App.tsx` file; types in `src/types.ts`, data in `src/data/mockData.ts`

## 1. Analytics Dashboard

**Route:** `dashboard`  
**Architecture:** [ARCHITECTURE.md §6](ARCHITECTURE.md#6-module-analytics-dashboard) · **Build phase:** 3 (data mart + live queries)

### Purpose

Monitor loyalty KPIs across customer engagement, point performance, transaction impact, channel performance, and campaigns. TBD business definitions surface as placeholder KPI cards (redemption rate by point, Cost). Production KPI definitions and data sources are specified in ARCHITECTURE.md §6.1; prototype uses seeded `PointTransaction[]` aggregated client-side via `src/data/aggregations.ts`.

### Key UI Elements

**Header:** Loyalty Analytics title, role switcher (`employee` | `approver` | `admin`), export menu (PDF/PNG).

**Filters** (`DashboardFilters`):

| Filter | Options | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Start / End date | Date inputs | Default from `defaultDashboardFilters` in mockData |
| Channel | All, Wondr, ATM, API, BNI Direct, Mbank, SMS | |
| Source system | All, Saving, Cardlink | |
| Transaction type | Purchase, Payment, transfers, VA | **Hidden** unless source = Saving |
| Campaign | Campaign selector | Used in before/after chart |

**KPI card groups** (computed from `aggregations.ts`):

1. **Customer Engagement** — CIF Earning, CIF Redeem, Redemption rate (by CIF), Redemption rate (by point) **TBD**
2. **Point Performance** — Points issued, Points redeemed, Point balance/liability, Expired points
3. **Cost** — Single **TBD** placeholder card
4. **Transaction Impact** — Earning per transaction type, Earning per source
5. **Channel Performance** — Redemption per channel, Top channel by earn/redeem, Top reward type
6. **Campaign** — Active campaign count, Participation rate, Top campaign

Each KPI card shows value, detail, and inline sparkline (`tabular-nums`). TBD cards use dashed border and "Definition pending" text.

**Charts & panels:**

| Component | Type | Data source |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Daily / Weekly / Monthly trend | Line + granularity toggle | `computeTrendSeries` |
| MoM / YoY growth | Delta cards | `computeGrowth` |
| Channel performance | Bar + donut + KPI cards | `computeChannelPerformance` |
| Campaign performance | Table + KPI cards | `computeCampaignKpis` |
| Before vs after campaign | Bar + window stepper (default 14d) | `computeBeforeAfterCampaign` |

**Other UI:**

- Export PDF / Export PNG — client-side via `html2canvas` + `jsPDF`
- Reconciliation panel — mock "Run Reconciliation Now" (Approver/Admin only), 5-entry run log
- Role switcher — dashboard-only; independent of earning/redemption rule role toggle

### User Flow

1. App loads with `dashboard` as default route
2. User reviews KPI cards and charts (all filter-driven)
3. User adjusts filters (dates, channel, source, transaction type)
4. If source ≠ Saving, transaction type resets to "all" and the field hides
5. User toggles trend granularity (daily/weekly/monthly)
6. User selects campaign and adjusts before/after window days
7. Approver/Admin runs mock reconciliation and reviews run log
8. Optional: Export PDF/PNG of current view

### State & Data

| State | Type | Location |
|-------|------|----------|
| `filters` | `DashboardFilters` | `DashboardPage` |
| `role` | `DashboardRole` | `DashboardPage` |
| `reconRuns` | `ReconciliationRun[]` | `DashboardPage` |
| `granularity` | `TrendGranularity` | `DashboardPage` |
| `windowDays` | `number` | `DashboardPage` (before/after campaign) |

**Data:** `mockTransactions` + `mockCampaigns` from `src/data/dashboardMockGenerator.ts`. All KPIs/charts call pure functions in `src/data/aggregations.ts` with `(transactions, campaigns, filters)`.

### Status

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| KPI cards + sparklines | Done (computed mock) |
| Charts + panels | Done (computed mock) |
| Filters | Done — global |
| Export PDF/PNG | Done (client-side) |
| Reconciliation mock | Done (role-gated) |
| Drill-down | Non-functional |
| Real-time SLA | Undefined |

## 2. Earning Rule Management

**Route:** `earning-rules`  
**Architecture:** [ARCHITECTURE.md §4](ARCHITECTURE.md#4-module-earning-rule--redemption-rule-engine) · **Build phase:** 1

### Purpose

Configure and review point-earning rules. Supports role-based editing and a full add/edit drawer with conditional fields per rule type.

**Tab structure (requirements vs prototype):** The architecture spec defines two tabs — **General** (`PointConfig`: point logo, name, expiry/reset policy) and **Rule** (rule list/CRUD). Only the **Rule** tab is implemented in the prototype today. Tab General is not started — see [ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1](ARCHITECTURE.md#41-tab-structure) and [§12 Prototype Alignment Matrix](ARCHITECTURE.md#12-prototype-alignment-matrix).

### Key UI Elements

- **Role toggle:** `employee` | `approver` (UI-only, no auth)
- **Summary counters:** Total rules + count per status (draft, in_review, scheduled, active, inactive, expired)
- **Search:** By rule name, code, or ID
- **Status filter:** All or specific `RuleStatus`
- **Data table columns:** No, Rule (name + code), Period, Type, Status, Created time, Total CIF, Total point, Actions
- **Actions:** Edit (role/status gated), Inactive (active rules only; non-functional)
- **Add rule drawer:** Side panel with conditional fields
- **Export:** CSV / XLSX buttons (non-functional)

**Mock data:** 6 earning rules in `rules` (filtered by `ruleMode: "EARN"`) covering all rule types and statuses.

### User Flows

#### Employee flow

1. Sidebar → **Earning Rule**
2. Role defaults to **employee**
3. View summary counters and rule table
4. Search and/or filter by status
5. **Edit** visible only on **draft** rules
6. Click **Add rule** → drawer opens with default type `transactional`
7. Select rule type → conditional fields appear
8. Review point calculation example
9. **Submit for review** or **Cancel** (no persistence)

#### Approver flow

1. Toggle role to **approver**
2. **Edit** available for `in_review` and `scheduled` rules
3. Same search, filter, and add flow as employee

### Permissions

```typescript
// src/domain/ruleStatus.ts — canEdit()
employee  → edit draft only
approver  → edit in_review, scheduled
```

### State & Data

| State | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `role` | `Role` | Edit permissions |
| `query` | `string` | Search filter |
| `status` | `RuleStatus \| "all"` | Status filter |
| `drawerOpen` | `boolean` | Drawer visibility |
| `drawerMode` | `"add" \| "edit"` | Drawer mode |
| `drawerRule` | `Rule \| null` | Rule being edited |
| `selectedType` | `RuleType` | Active rule type in drawer |
| `periodStart` / `periodEnd` | `string` | Rule period in drawer (`DateRangeField`; synced on open) |

**Data:** `getRulesByMode("EARN")` from unified `rules` in `src/data/mockData.ts`, type `Rule` from `src/domain/rule.ts`

### Status

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Tab General (`PointConfig`) | Not started |
| Tab Rule — list / search / filter | Done |
| Tab Rule — role-gated edit | Done (UI) |
| Tab Rule — add/edit drawer | Done (UI) |
| Tab Rule — period date range picker | Done (UI) — `DateRangeField` |
| Tab Rule — submit / save | Non-functional |
| Tab Rule — inactive toggle | Non-functional |
| Tab Rule — export | Non-functional |

### Planned: Tab General (`PointConfig`)

Single-record form (requirements). Target fields per [ARCHITECTURE.md §3](ARCHITECTURE.md#3-core-domain-model):

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `point_logo` | Point currency branding |
| `point_name` | Display name for loyalty points |
| `expired_duration_value` + `expired_duration_unit` | Expiry policy (e.g. 12 monthly) |
| `reset_time` | Calendar reset time (semantics TBD — Gap #5) |

No `PointConfig` type, mock record, or UI exists in the prototype yet.

---

## 3. Redemption Rule Management

**Route:** `redemption-rules`  
**Architecture:** [ARCHITECTURE.md §4](ARCHITECTURE.md#4-module-earning-rule--redemption-rule-engine) · **Build phase:** 1

### Purpose

Configure and review point-redemption rules. Same UX as earning rules with redemption-specific fields. Architecturally, earning and redemption share one Rule Engine with a `rule_mode` flag (EARN/REDEEM) — the prototype uses shared `RuleModule` with `ruleMode: "EARN" | "REDEEM"` and a unified `Rule` type. See [ARCHITECTURE.md §1](ARCHITECTURE.md#1-scope--reading-of-the-source-spec).

### Key UI Elements

Same as Earning Rule Management, plus:

- **Extra table column:** Cap type (`rule.redemption.capType`)
- **Drawer fields:** Cap type, value point percentage, value min, value max

**Open question:** `ruleTabId` and `sourceTypeId` appear on redemption mock data (`rule.redemption`) with no definition in the source spec — flagged as Gap #4 in [ARCHITECTURE.md §9](ARCHITECTURE.md#9-gaps--open-questions-to-resolve-before-build).

**Cap types** (`RedemptionHeader.capType`):

`cashback`, `discount`, `bill_payment`, `donasi`, `point_pihak_ketiga`, `kupon_undian`, `voucher`, `e_wallet`, `lelang`, `barang`, `annual_fee`

**Mock data:** 5 redemption rules in `rules` (filtered by `ruleMode: "REDEEM"`).

### User Flow

Same as earning rules (employee and approver flows). Redemption-specific drawer fields appear when `ruleMode === "REDEEM"`.

### Permissions

Identical to earning rules (`canEdit` in `src/domain/ruleStatus.ts`).

### State & Data

Same state shape as `RuleModule` with `ruleMode: "REDEEM"`. Data from `getRulesByMode("REDEEM")`, type `Rule`.

### Status

Same capability breakdown as Earning Rule — Rule tab only (no Tab General on redemption route; `PointConfig` lives under Earning Rule per requirements). List, drawer, role-gated edit done (UI); submit/save, inactive toggle, and export non-functional.

---

## 4. Rule Drawer (Shared)

Used by both Earning and Redemption rule modules.

### Purpose

Side panel for creating or editing rules. Fields change based on selected `RuleType`.

### Base Fields (all types)

- Rule name, Rule code
- **Rule period** — single `DateRangeField` (`src/components/DateRangeField.tsx`) bound to `periodStart` / `periodEnd`; dual-month calendar popover with range highlight, Apply/Clear; synced from rule on drawer open (add/edit)
- Rule type selector

### Redemption-only Fields

- Cap type, Value point percentage, Value min, Value max

### Conditional Fields by Rule Type

| Rule Type | Key Fields |
|-----------|------------|
| `activity` | Activity type, Amount field, Receive point / Redeem point |
| `third_party_points` | `card_type` multi-select; repeatable **Partner Earning Blocks** each with tier table (`operator_type`, amount, `miles_point`) and per-block accumulation cap (`cap_type`, `timeframe`, `max_capacity`) — see [ARCHITECTURE.md §4.4.1](ARCHITECTURE.md#441-third-party-points--detailed-structure-working-assumption) |
| `personal_earning` | Type (birthday), Target user (CSV upload), Reward type, Receive point |
| `transactional` | Source system, Transaction type, Merchant category/name, Card type, Channel, Transaction amount, Conversion unit, Multiplier, Max capacity, Type/timeframe max capacity |
| `tactical` | Campaign/event name, Target user, Reward type + all transactional fields |

### Point Calculation

Example shown in drawer using `calculatePoints()` from `src/utils/points.ts`:

```
Earned/Redeem Points = floor((transactionAmount / conversionUnit) × multiplier)
Example: (500,000 / 100,000) × 10 = 50 poin
```

### Drawer Actions

| Action | Add mode | Edit mode | Persistence |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Cancel | Closes drawer | Closes drawer | — |
| Submit for review / Save changes | Shown | Shown | Non-functional |

## 5. User Management (Placeholder)

**Route:** `users`

### Purpose

Future module for user list and loyalty profiles.

### Current State

Navigation slot only. Shows "Ready for next detail pass" placeholder.

### Planned Scope

- User list with search/filter
- Loyalty profile detail view
- Role/permission assignment (TBD)

---

## 6. Rewards Points Management (Placeholder)

**Route:** `rewards`

### Purpose

Future module for reward catalog and stock management.

### Current State

Navigation slot only. Shows "Ready for next detail pass" placeholder.

### Planned Scope

- Reward catalog (voucher, barang, e-wallet, etc.)
- Stock and availability tracking
- Linkage to redemption rules

---

## 7. Reporting (Placeholder)

**Route:** `reporting`  
**Architecture:** [ARCHITECTURE.md §7](ARCHITECTURE.md#7-module-reporting) · **Build phase:** 4

### Purpose

Centralized reporting for earning, redemption, manual operations, pembukuan, and reconciliation. Six report types map to data sources in ARCHITECTURE.md §7 (ledger facts, manual ops tables, batch job logs).

### Current State

Tab bar UI with 6 report types. Content area is a dashed placeholder. Only tab switching works.

### Report Tabs

| Tab | Description | Arch. data source | Prototype |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Earning Poin | Earning point reports | `fact_point_transaction` (EARN) | Placeholder |
| Redemption Poin | Redemption point reports | `fact_point_transaction` (REDEEM) | Placeholder |
| Manual Adjustment | Manual point adjustments | `manual_adjustment` table | Placeholder |
| Manual Redemption | Manual redemption operations | Separate manual ops table | Placeholder |
| Hasil pemrosesan pembukuan | Bookkeeping processing results | Posting job-run log | Placeholder |
| Hasil rekonsiliasi sistem | System reconciliation results | `reconciliation_run` table | Placeholder |

### Planned Scope

Per-tab: report table, filters, export actions, reconciliation status.

## Open Items / Business Sign-Off

From `auditNotes` in `src/data/mockData.ts`. These items need stakeholder resolution before backend integration. Architecture-level gaps (rule engine, PointConfig, expiry semantics, third-party points, etc.) are consolidated in [ARCHITECTURE.md §9](ARCHITECTURE.md#9-gaps--open-questions-to-resolve-before-build) — avoid maintaining two divergent gap lists.

| # | Item | ARCH §9 ref |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Metric formulas** — Redemption rate by point vs by CIF, point balance liability, expired points, participation rate, growth, and campaign comparison need sign-off. | #8 |
| 2 | **Estimated Point Cost** — Cost is mentioned in requirements but no KPI definition exists; currently a placeholder. | #9 |
| 3 | **Real-time SLA** — Undefined; prototype shows "Last updated: just now" without polling. | #10 |
| 4 | **Filter sources** — Filter options are mocked. Transaction type only enabled when source = Saving. | #11 |
| 5 | **Drill-down targets** — Not specified; "View details" actions are intentionally non-functional. | #12 |
| 6 | **Reconciliation workflow** — Referenced operationally but remains in Reporting until workflow ownership is defined. | #13 |
| 7 | **Campaign comparison** — Requires selected campaign and baseline period; prototype uses mock campaign periods. | #14 |
| 8 | **Finance governance** — Liability and expired points are read-only; likely need audit trails. | #15 |

**Rule-engine gaps** (not duplicated here): Cardlink channels (#1), merchant category (#2), redemption sign semantics (#3), `ruleTabId`/`sourceTypeId` (#4), expiry semantics (#5), third-party per-block card subset (#16), `PointConfig` shared record (#7) — see [ARCHITECTURE.md §9](ARCHITECTURE.md#9-gaps--open-questions-to-resolve-before-build). Third-party nesting is a **working assumption** per Update 2 (Gap #6).

## Changes Tracking

Timestamped log of prototype changes. Git commit hash included when available.

| Timestamp (WIB) | Commit | Area | Change |
|-----------------|--------|------|--------|
| 2026-06-25 14:00 | — | Unified Rule Engine | Merged `EarningRule`/`RedemptionRule` into single `Rule` with `ruleMode` (EARN/REDEEM) and polymorphic `RuleConfig`. Added `src/domain/rule.ts`, `ruleStatus.ts`, `ruleConfig.ts`, `src/services/ruleQueries.ts`, `ruleWorkflow.ts`. Mock data consolidated to `rules[]` + `getRulesByMode()`. `RuleModule`/`RuleDrawer` use `ruleMode` instead of `kind`. |
| 2026-06-25 11:55 | `f804673` | Earning / Redemption rule drawer | Replaced Period start/end text placeholders with **Rule period** `DateRangeField` — click-to-open dual-month range calendar, Apply/Clear, controlled `periodStart`/`periodEnd` state in `RuleDrawer`. Added `src/components/DateRangeField.tsx`. Fixed `postcss.config.js` ESM plugin imports. |
| 2026-06-25 11:25 | `31d9cf1` | Rule drawer — conditional fields | Third-party points nested **Partner Earning Blocks** (tier table + per-block caps). Personal earning reuses target-user/reward fields. Documented in ARCHITECTURE.md §4.4.1. |
| 2026-06-25 11:00 | `b2cfdd6` | Docs + rule drawer | Added `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Transactional/tactical dropdowns for source system, transaction type, merchant, card, channel, caps. Tactical/personal earning target-user CSV upload UI. |

## Maintenance

Update this file when:

- New routes or modules are added to navigation
- Placeholder modules (Users, Rewards, Reporting) are implemented
- Business rules are signed off — move resolved items out of [Open Items](#open-items--business-sign-off) and update [ARCHITECTURE.md §9](ARCHITECTURE.md#9-gaps--open-questions-to-resolve-before-build) accordingly
- Backend integration changes flows, state, or data models
- Non-functional actions become wired up (export, drill-down, CRUD persistence)
- Tab General (`PointConfig`) is implemented or architecture gaps in §9 are resolved
- Any shipped UI or flow change — append a row to [Changes Tracking](#changes-tracking) with timestamp and commit hash
- **Cursor PRD rules** — when any module section above changes, update the matching `.cursor/rules/prd-*.mdc` file (see [Cursor PRD rules](#cursor-prd-rules))

### Cursor PRD rules

Per-module PRDs for the Cursor agent live in `.cursor/rules/`. **`FEATURES.md` is the source of truth** — keep rules in sync when module scope, flows, status, or data shapes change.

| Route key | Module | Cursor rule file | `FEATURES.md` section |
|-----------|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| — | Global context (stack, nav, constraints) | `.cursor/rules/00-project-context.mdc` | [Overview](#overview), [Navigation Map](#navigation-map) |

**Sync checklist** (after editing a module in this file):

1. Update the matching `prd-*.mdc` — purpose, UI, flows, status table, and open items for that module only.
2. If navigation or global constraints change, update `00-project-context.mdc`.
3. If shared drawer fields or lifecycle change, update `prd-rule-drawer.mdc` and cross-check earning/redemption rules.
4. Keep rules concise (agent context); link here and to `ARCHITECTURE.md` for full detail.
